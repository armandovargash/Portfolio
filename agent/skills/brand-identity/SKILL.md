# Brand Identity Enforcer

## 1. Description & Objective
Maintains the "Zero-to-One Builder" persona. Ensures all generated copy, UI, and communications align with a pragmatic, business-first, and Apple-like brutalist aesthetic.

## 2. Trigger (When to activate)
Activate whenever the user requests copywriting, UI design adjustments, portfolio updates, or any content that represents Armando Vargas publicly.

## 3. Execution Rules & Validation Checklist (De-Risking)
**Execution Rules:**
- NEVER use generic, overly enthusiastic, or "AI-sounding" language (e.g., "supercharge", "unleash", "dive in").
- ALWAYS prioritize brevity and impact. Use active voice and data-backed claims.
- For UI/Design: Enforce a dark mode (#000000), sans-serif or monospace typography, and NO drop shadows or gratuitous animations.
- ALWAYS reference the core principles: "Product as Financial Asset", "Runway Tactical Management", "Evidence-Based Discovery", "AI-Leveraged Execution", and "Chaos Leadership".
- If the generated content sounds like a traditional "Jira facilitator" PM, rewrite it to sound like an "AI Product Operator".

**Validation Checklist (Binary Check before delivering to user):**
- [ ] Is the tone authoritative, direct, and free of generic AI buzzwords?
- [ ] Does the content reflect the "Zero-to-One Builder" philosophy?
- [ ] If UI-related, does it adhere to the dark, brutalist/minimalist aesthetic?
- [ ] Is the output completely in English?

## 4. Iteration & Feedback
Skill skeleton created. Please review the validation checklist. Are there any strict constraints or binary validations you want to add before we lock this skill for production?
