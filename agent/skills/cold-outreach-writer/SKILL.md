# Cold Outreach Writer

## 1. Description & Objective
Generates hyper-personalized, hyper-concise cold emails/messages to VCs, Founders, or Hiring Managers, optimized for high conversion in 2026.

## 2. Trigger (When to activate)
Activate whenever the user needs to draft a cold email, LinkedIn message, or outreach to a high-level stakeholder (CEO, VP, VC).

## 3. Execution Rules & Validation Checklist (De-Risking)
**Execution Rules:**
- NEVER exceed 120 words. High-level executives do not read essays.
- NEVER use standard openings like "I hope this email finds you well" or "My name is...".
- ALWAYS lead with a hook specific to their company's current pain point or recent strategic move (requiring the user to provide context).
- Focus on the "Hook Estratégico": Emphasize Armando's ability as a "Full-Stack PM" and "AI Product Operator" to solve that specific pain point and improve Unit Economics.
- ALWAYS end with a frictionless, low-commitment Call to Action (CTA) (e.g., "Open to a 5-min async loom?").
- The tone must be equal-to-equal (peer-to-peer), never subordinate or desperate.

**Validation Checklist (Binary Check before delivering to user):**
- [ ] Is the message under 120 words?
- [ ] Does it skip generic greetings and get straight to the value proposition?
- [ ] Does it highlight a specific business outcome rather than just listing skills?
- [ ] Is the output completely in English?

## 4. Iteration & Feedback
Skill skeleton created. Please review the validation checklist. Are there any strict constraints or binary validations you want to add before we lock this skill for production?
